# Association-Analysis-Cardiac-SPECT-Diagnosis

# Object
To use data mining technique with SPECT dataset in order to perform Apriori association
analysis on each type of patients, and find 5 rules for each type of patients.

# Scope
● Datasets was retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SPECT+Heart:
      ○ Given 2 datasets which are SPECT.train and SPECT.test
● Total No.of records: 267 patients
● Attributes: 23 attributes: Binary attributes 0 1
      ○ 1st attribute: healthy heart (diagnosis=0), unhealthy heart (diagnosis=1)
      ○ 2nd - 23rd attributes: high perfusion (diagnosis=0), poor perfusion (diagnosis=1)
      
# Expected result
● The set of rules with high confidence value for patients that has normal cardiac health.
● The set of rules with high confidence value for patients that has abnormal cardiac health.
